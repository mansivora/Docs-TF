**Trade Finance Overview**

![overview](/assets/overview.png)

According to the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) 2017 report, world trade flows will grow at an annual rate of about 4.3% to reach nearly 19USD Trillion by 2020. Majority of this trade is driven by global infrastructure development due to increased population and urbanization. As per Global infrastructure hub 2017 report, by 2040, the global population will grow by almost 2 Billion people a 25% increase. Also, rural to urban migration will skew this growth more towards urban areas leading to an urban population growing by 46 USD. This will trigger massive demand for infrastructure support, especially in an urban area and to keep pace with this growth, the global infrastructure investment needs are forecasted to reach 94 USD Trillion by 2040, which is an average of 3.7 USD Trillion per year. Based on current spending levels, the shortfall is more than 18 USD Trillion which is around a Trillion dollar gap every year.

To fuel this massive infrastructure growth, financial institutions and banks are supposed to pump money into the ecosystem. However, decreasing trust factor and increasing risk have made it difficult for businesses and individuals to access trade finance or they are denied trade finance due to increased regulatory and compliance limitations of traditional financing system.

Of the global financing needs today, infrastructure remains the most sizeable and critical financing need for both developed as well as developing countries. And, even after being pivotal to any country’s social-economic progress, infrastructure financing still remains underserved. Why? Financing sector suffers from a lot of inefficiencies. Infrastructure financing being the most unglamorous industry receives very less support from the private sector leading to an increasing tax burden on govt. and consequently on the general public. Inefficient, time-consuming and paper-based financing further adds to the cost of capital. Even finance rates vary a lot worldwide and presence of intermediaries makes centralized funds inaccessible to people. Therefore, the present financial ecosystem is incapable of fulfilling the burgeoning financing demand, leading to huge loss of opportunity for global trade and in turn, economic development which requires a disruptive technology like blockchain to innovate financing mechanism to complement traditional banking and finance.

We are convinced that the complementing technological, legal, global finance and trading expertise brought in by our consortium members will accelerate development of this standards-based platform and eventual market adoption.
